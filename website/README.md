Title: New-beginnings
July 2018
By: Shenikia Thomas


What It Is:
New-beginnings is a project created while in Code Louisville that is my first attempt at web development. New-beginnings is a foundational page that I will continue to build on.  In its current state, new-beginnings is an introduction to the different business ventures I am currently pursuing.

How Does It Work:
Currently, new-beginnings gives a pop-up greeting and a small introduction of myself and my 'reasons why', which will be explained more in depth as I advance the page.  It exhibits collapsible cards that give a brief description of my business ventures. At the bottom of the page is a sample form to be filled out. At this time, when the signup button is clicked, will render a 'thank you' for visiting the page and, at a later date, will connect to a specific form based on the visitors choice of checkbox.

Who Wil Use It:
New-beginnings is open to all.

What Is The Goal:
The hope is that whoever visits New-beginnings page will have interest enough to inquire about a service or to be of service.

Special Requirements:
New-beginnings is located on GitHub. There are no special instructions for this page.

Permissions:
Please do not make any major changes without getting permission.


Thank you for taking the time to view my page and I look forward to hearing from you with any questions or concerns you may have.
